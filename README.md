# MavG
 Indicator Project

So far the main project only has textual indicators. 

Graphical indicator examples and attempts are in the example code folder.

Kivy and mavlink must be installed

The indicators can be tested using Mission Planner on windows machines:
 Open a simulator 
 Start Mavlink Mirror:
  TCP Host : 14551 (this port is what is in the code currently)

Testing under Linux requires the Ardupilot SITL to be running.
